This project will work through the naming of ID's and classes by putting your first name infront of everyrthing for example,
if Stuart has a login button and want's to give the button the ID of login, he'll call it Stuart_Login. If Erman has a class that he
wants to call LoginActivity, he'll call it ErmanLoginActivity
